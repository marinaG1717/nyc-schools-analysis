## 📌 Insights
- Bronx schools account for nearly **one-third of all incidents (28.2%)**, making it the borough with a significant share of reported cases.  
- The majority of incidents are categorized as **`nocrim_n`**, which suggests that schools more often report **non-criminal or low-level issues** rather than violent or property crimes.  
- A handful of schools report **unusually high incident counts** compared to peers of similar size. This may indicate:
  - Differences in reporting practices, or  
  - Actual higher rates of behavioral issues.
