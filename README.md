# ðŸ—½ NYC Schools Data Analysis  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores multiple **NYC Department of Education datasets** to uncover insights about school incidents, demographics, directory information, and SAT performance.  

The work is divided into four major parts:
1. **Incident Analysis** â€“ Examining patterns in school safety incidents.  
2. **School Directory Exploration** â€“ Understanding school distribution, size, and grade spans across boroughs.  
3. **Database Queries** â€“ Using SQL (via Python) to answer questions from the integrated datasets.  
4. **Database Population & SAT Results** â€“ Cleaning and integrating SAT data into a PostgreSQL database.  

The goal of this project is to **practice data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and SQL integration**, while producing insights that could inform school policy and planning.
